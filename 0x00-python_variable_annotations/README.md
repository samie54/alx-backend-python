Project: Python - Variable Annotations
Author: Samuel Atiemo

Project Tasks:

0. Basic annotations - add
mandatory
Write a type-annotated function add that takes a float a and a float b as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

1. Basic annotations - concat
mandatory
Write a type-annotated function concat that takes a string str1 and a string str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string

2. Basic annotations - floor
mandatory
Write a type-annotated function floor which takes a float n as argument and returns the floor of the float.

3. Basic annotations - to string
mandatory
Write a type-annotated function to_str that takes a float n as argument and returns the string representation of the float.

4. Define variables
mandatory

5. Complex types - list of floats
mandatory
Write a type-annotated function sum_list which takes a list input_list of floats as argument and returns their sum as a float.

6. Complex types - mixed list
mandatory
Write a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list which takes a list mxd_lst of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

7. Complex types - string and int/float to tuple
mandatory
Write a type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string k and an int OR float v as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string k. The second element is the square of the int/float v and should be annotated as a float.

8. Complex types - functions
mandatory
Write a type-annotated function make_multiplier that takes a float multiplier as argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by multiplier.

9. Let's duck type an iterable object
mandatory
Annotate the below functionâ€™s parameters and return values with the appropriate types

10. Duck typing - first element of a sequence
#advanced

11. More involved type annotations
#advanced
Given the parameters and the return values, add type annotations to the function

12. Type Checking
#advanced
Use mypy to validate the following piece of code and apply any necessary changes.
